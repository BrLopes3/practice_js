14) 	create a function called comment which takes a mark as an argument and returns a string:
		returns "average" if the mark is between 50 and 60 (excluded)
		returns "good" if the mark is between 60 and 80 (excluded)
		returns "great" if the mark is above 80
		returns "bad" otherwise

15) 	create a function called classify which takes a string as an argument and
		returns "this is a fruit" if the argument is "apple", "orange", "banana", "pear" or "mango"
		returns "this is a vegetable" if the argument is "carrot", "eggplant", "parsnip", "turnip" or "zucchini"

16) 	iterate through myArray and for each element, connect strings, its index and its value in order to display the following in the console:
		"the value for element 0 is 35"
		"the value for element 1 is hello world"
		"the value for element 2 is true"
		"the value for element 3 is 46
		...

17) 	In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n - by convention, the factorial of 0 is 1.
	For example, factorial of 3 is 1*2*3 = 6 and factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.

	create a function called factorial which takes a number as argument and returns its factorial.

18)	create a function named withdraw which takes one amount and returns an array containing a bundle of bank notes (100, 50, 20, 10, 5) - for example:
		withdraw(320) -> ["3 x 100-dollar bill(s)", "1 x 20-dollar bill(s)"]
		withdraw(450) -> ["4 x 100-dollar bill(s)", "2 x 20-dollar bill(s)", "1 x 10-dollar bill(s)"]
		withdraw(75) -> ["3 x 20-dollar bill(s)", "1 x 10-dollar bill(s)", "1 x 5-dollar bill(s)"]
		withdraw(575) -> ["5 x 100-dollar bill", "1 x 50-dollar bill", "1 x 20-dollar bill", "1 x 5-dollar bill"]

19)	create an array called students that contains 5 students, each with an id, first name, last name and grades as follows:

	   id   |       first name      |       last name       |       grades
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   10   |       Fernando        |       Lopez           |       78, 85, 90
	   13   |       Miranda         |       Kahan           |       72, 95, 89
	   17   |       Lisa            |       Xiao            |       62, 76, 95

20)	create a function called average that takes an array of students as argument and returns a new array containing the rounded average of each student's grades - for example:
		average(students) -> [84, 85, 78]
